# 👋 Hi there, I'm Mareeswaran

## 🚀 About Me
I'm an aspiring **Automation Developer** and an MCA student with a passion for building real-world solutions using no-code/low-code platforms and AI tools. I enjoy combining tools like **n8n**, **Telegram**, **Google Apps**, and **OpenAI/Ollama** to create smart automations and personal productivity bots.

Currently, I’m also exploring **Solidity** to dive into the world of **decentralized applications (DApps)**.
